# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
This is a map that updates live every 15 seconds with the locations of buses around MIT. It communicates with Mapbox to render the map on the page.

## How to Run:
To run this code, you can download the html, css, and javascript files, and open them with a file editor--such as VS Code. You will also need to create an account on Mapbox, which is a javascript library that allows you to render maps on your pages. You will also need to have whatever icon you want to use as your marker in the same folder as the code.

## Roadmap
I don't have a lot of plans for this repository. However, it would be cool to figure out how to render maps of different areas and include landmarks that I am actually familiar with. It would also be interesting to find out what other types of maps I can use with Mapbox, i.e. satallite maps or topography maps.
